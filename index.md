## Fundraisr: Contributing Made Easy

### What is Fundraisr?
Fundraisr creates webpages with a cryptocurrency miner, which is software that does a bunch of math for a cryptocurrency. In exchange for having your computer do that math a cryptocurrency will give you a some of it's coin. Fundraisr lets your contributors navigate to a [webpage](#what-does-it-look-like) and mine for you while sending 70% of the coin to you. By having hundreds of users leave the webpage open in the background or even overnight they can contribute without having to deal with cash.

### Don't Have a Monero Wallet?
Luckily there are plenty of Monero resources and wallets available. We don't have any specific recommendations but give it a google, get a wallet, and get started.
