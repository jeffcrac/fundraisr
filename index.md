## Fundraisr: Contributing Made Easy

### What is Fundraisr?
Fundraisr creates webpages with a cryptocurrency miner, which is software that does a bunch of math for a cryptocurrency. In exchange for having your computer do that math a cryptocurrency will give you a some of it's coin. Fundraisr lets your contributors navigate to a [webpage](#what-does-it-look-like) and mine for you while sending 70% of the coin to you. By having hundreds of users leave the webpage open in the background or even overnight they can contribute without having to deal with cash.

Luckily there are plenty of Monero resources and wallets available. We don't have any specific recommendations but give it a google, get a wallet, and get started.
